### Hi, I am Nathan!

I am a student-entrepreneur passionate in building software that helps people in their day-to-day lives. Creating products for the userâ€™s convenience has been a deep desire within me. Currently, I am building an Out-of-Home advertising startup that provides ease of deployment through our web app, as well as quality targeted content to the audiences. As of now, I have experience in developing fullstack web and machine learning applications throughout my personal and university-based projects.

My vision is to live with no regrets. I strongly believe in developing myself holistically and impacting others as the key to experiencing life as much as I can. With this, I always aspire to try out every opportunity I have ASAP to learn as much as possible.
